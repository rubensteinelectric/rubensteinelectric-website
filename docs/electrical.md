Whether you are looking to upgrade a bedroom lamp, warehouse fluorescents, or parking lot pole fixtures, LEDs can provide you with brighter lights that are easier on the eyes and use only a fraction of the power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a dimmer? The LED lights we install can be fitted with special dimmer switches specially designed to work with LEDs, and are an easy swap out.  Feel free to call us for more information.</p>
